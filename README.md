# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
:sparkles: Optional scripting project by Holberton School on RSA Challenge

## Project Description
* We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents. 
* It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. 
* Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.
